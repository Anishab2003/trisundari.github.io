  <h1>About TriSundari</h1>
<p><strong>TriSundari</strong> 
TriSundari, a space where research becomes reflection.

<p>The name TriSundari is inspired by Tripura Sundarī, a concept describing the harmony of three worlds - the physical (our bodies), the mental (our minds), and the subtle (our intuition). In this space, that idea becomes a framework for inquiry: how biology, psychology, and lived experience shape one another.
The Body examines new research in medicine and health, seeing physiology not as a fixed system but as an evolving story shaped by heritage, diversity, and experience.
 The Mind explores psychology and the nervous system,  how emotion, awareness, and resilience rewire the self.
 The Lineage traces the histories and cultures that have shaped our understanding of the body and mind,  remembering knowledge that was forgotten, silenced or modified.
Together, these threads form a single question:
 What does it mean to understand ourselves, scientifically, historically, and humanly?
I created TriSundari as a space to hold that question. It grew from my own search to bridge two ways of seeing: the analytical and the intuitive. My background in physics taught me the precision of pattern; my passions in art, music, philosophy and solitude continue to teach me to listen.
