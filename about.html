  <h1>About TriSundari</h1>
  <h1><span class="bindu">TriSundari</span></h1>

  <p><strong>TriSundari</strong> - a space where research becomes reflection.</p>

  <p>
    The name <em>TriSundari</em> is inspired by <em>Tripura Sundarī</em>, a concept describing the harmony of three worlds:
    the physical (<em>our bodies</em>), the mental (<em>our minds</em>), and the subtle (<em>our intuition</em>).
    In this space, that idea becomes a framework for inquiry - how biology, psychology, and lived experience shape one another.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Body</strong> examines new research in medicine and health, seeing physiology not as a fixed system
    but as an evolving story shaped by heritage, diversity, and experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Mind</strong> explores psychology and the nervous system - how emotion, awareness, and resilience rewire the self.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Lineage</strong> traces the histories and cultures that have shaped our understanding of the body and mind 
    remembering knowledge that was forgotten, silenced, or transformed.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Together, these threads form a single question:<br>
    <em>What does it mean to understand ourselves - scientifically, historically, and humanly?</em>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I created <em>TriSundari</em> as a space to hold that question. It grew from my own search to bridge two ways of seeing:
    the analytical and the intuitive. My background in physics taught me the precision of pattern; my passions in art,
    music,philosophy and solitude continue to teach me how to listen.
